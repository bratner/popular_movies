Udacity second nanodegree project

This project requires an active https://www.themoviedb.org API key.
There are two ways to set up the key, listed in the order of priority:
1. After obtaining the key, generate a file named project.properties at the root of this project and add the following line to it: 'API_KEY=\<YOUR API KEY\>'
2. Set an environemnt variable TMDB_API_KEY to hold your key. Make sure the environment variable is available to your Android Studio (or gradle).

If API_KEY is not found then gradle sync will fail.
